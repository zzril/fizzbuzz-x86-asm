Info:
=====

An (x86) assembly version of the (in)famous "FizzBuzz" program.  
I made this just for fun and for personal training purposes.  
For a (pseudo-) copyright notice, see in the source code.

---

Build & run:
============

Build with `make`, run with `./fizzbuzz <divisor1> <divisor2> <maximum>`.  
Requires:
* `nasm`
* `ld.lld`

---

Test:
=====

* `./run.sh` will run the program with some "normal" parameters.
* `./test.sh` does the same and also executes a bunch of tests for edge cases.

---

Contribute:
===========

The program is pretty much complete, but if you find bugs or have suggestions  
to improve the code, you're welcome.
